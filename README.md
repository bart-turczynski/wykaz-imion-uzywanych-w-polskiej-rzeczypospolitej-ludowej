This repository stores data on names present in *Wykaz imion używanych w Polskiej Rzeczypospolitej Ludowej*, an article published in *Język Polski. 1983, nr 1/2 (styczeń/kwiecień)*.

The article presents a list of names that is still used by the Council for the Polish Language when opining on appropriate and inappropriate baby names.

From a native speaker\'s perspective, these names feel dated; many of them aren\'t in use anymore, and even more are rather obscure. However, it\'s an interesting source of information on names used in Poland until 1983 (with an additional caveat that the list comprises more than 1,000 names that have been selected based on the expert judgement of Józef Bubak and the Council for the Polish Language; the criteria aren\'t clear, but it seems that some names made the list because it was obvious they were popular; some were chosen because the were traditional Polish names).
